#### More logs more simple!

More and more Node.js applications are victims of brute-force attack if you have an authentication space. Trap.js was designed to lock those users.

Trap.js can store all connexion attempt during a predefined time and ban user if he got much connect attempt. But that's not all! Trap.js will 
check if an account is a victim of brute force attacks and if it does, it will temporarily lock it!
